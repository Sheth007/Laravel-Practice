## 🧠 how this code works

1st : I tried simple smtp with email but the thing is I have to give my personal email id to do thats its okay,
- now after giving the personal email they need to varify me via mobile number  so I am not doing that.

2nd : then I tried "MailTrap" which is free to use and gives access to send the emails,
- now in MailTrap you can just send mail to your self so in 'to' and 'from' enter you email id thats it,
- you can not send emails to outside you can just send it to your self thats it.

3rd : I also tried facade methods but the same as smtp need to varify the email.
- the reason is I have to create another passkey for gmail app.

## 🔑 the solution

* to send the email first update everything properly and use latest versions only
* then you can use "Mailtrap" or "Maligun" to send the email properly
